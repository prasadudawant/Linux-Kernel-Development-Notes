### git email configurations

we need one server/host and one email client for successful email configuration. I am using gmail as server/host and MUTT as email client. You are free to choose anything. Refer [https://useplaintext.email/](https://useplaintext.email/), [https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/email-clients.html](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/email-clients.html). \
git email is also email client but we will use it only for sending patch email and mutt to be able send responses, to review comments, and other communication with the community.

### **Gmail account setup(Server)**

1. create new google account for linux kernel developement. This is optional but I recommend.
2. Configure your Google Account to have&#x20;
   1. **2-factor authentication** (to enable app-specific passwords)
   2. an **app-specific password** for gmail to be used by `git send-email`:
3.  **Configure 2-factor authentication:** \
    go to [https://myaccount.google.com/security](https://myaccount.google.com/security) --> scroll down to "2-Step Verification" and follow the process to turn it on.

    <figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (3).png" alt=""><figcaption><p><strong>Configure 2-factor authentication for gmail</strong></p></figcaption></figure>
4.  **Generate an app-specific password of Gmail for git to use:** \
    go to the link just above, scroll down to "App passwords" and click on it. Select "Mail" as the app and Select "Other _(Custom name)_" as the device. Name device as _git send-email_ or similar. Click the "GENERATE" button. It will pop up with a 16-digit full-access password. Write it down, without the spaces in it. It is just the 16 chars.

    <figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (4).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>select "MAIL" as app</p></figcaption></figure>

    <figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (2).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>select "other" as device</p></figcaption></figure>


5. Similarly generate password for mutt.
6. In **Gmail,**
   1. click on gear icon and go to settings
   2. &#x20;go to tab _**Forwarding POP/IMAP**_ and click the _**Configuration instructions**_ link in IMAP Access row.
   3. click "I want to enable IMAP"
   4. At the bottom of the page, under the paragraph about configuring your mail client, select _**Other**_.&#x20;
   5. Note the mail server information and use that information for further settings as shown in the next section.

### **git send-email/gitconfig setup(client)**

* we need to do git-email configuration to send patches using send-email command.
* Once you place the configuration in your **.gitconfig** file, running **git send-email mypatch.patch** is all you have to do to send patches; **mypatch.patch** is generated by the **git format-patch** command.

1.  update \~/.gitconfig as follows:

    _Note: change your name, email id and SMTP server details setting if not using Gmail._\
    __read for more at [https://git-send-email.io/](https://git-send-email.io/), [https://useplaintext.email/](https://useplaintext.email/), [https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/email-clients.html](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/email-clients.html)

    {% code overflow="wrap" lineNumbers="true" %}
    ```
    [user]
    	name = Prasad Sunil Udawant
    	email = prasad.udawant.linux@gmail.com
    	
    [sendemail]
    	from = Prasad Sunil Udawant <prasad.udawant.linux@gmail.com>
    	smtpuser = prasad.udawant.linux@gmail.com
    	smtpencryption = tls
    	smtpserver = smtp.gmail.com
    	smtpserverPort = 587
    	chainreplyto = false
    	smtpPass = <get this password from google app password we configured in above steps for git-send email app>
    	confirm = always
    	annotate = true

    [format]
        	signoff=true
    [core]
    	editor = vi
    ```
    {% endcode %}
2. set following configuration for safety&#x20;
   1.  to open email in git editor for review.

       _`git config --global sendemail.annotate true`_
   2.  to always confirm before sending email

       _`git config --global sendemail.confirm always`_
   3.  After setting this perform dry-run by executing following to confirm setup is ready. it will not send email.

       _git send-email --to="\<yout email id >" --dry-run \<patch path>_
   4. &#x20;Make sure that the email you specify here is the same email you used to set up sending mail. The Linux kernel developers will not accept a patch where the "From" email differs from the "Signed-off-by" line, which is what will happen if these two emails do not match. Make sure you store your full, legal name in the 'name' line

### **Setting up mutt with Gmail on Ubuntu (email client)**

1. Install mutt\
   _`sudo apt install mutt`_
2. Create directories for mutt to store the cache message headers and bodies, and store certificates, by entering the following commands:\
   _`mkdir -p ~/.mutt/cache/headers`_ \
   _`mkdir ~/.mutt/cache/bodies`_ \
   _`touch ~/.mutt/certificates`_
3. Create a configuration file of mutt: muttrc\
   `touch ~/.mutt/muttrc`
4.  Update muttrc file with following code. Replace Email id and password wherever implied.

    {% code overflow="wrap" lineNumbers="true" %}
    ```
    # .muttrc
    # ================  IMAP ====================
    set imap_user = 'username@gmail.com'
    set imap_pass = <get this password from google app password>
    set folder = imaps://imap.gmail.com/
    set spoolfile = imaps://imap.gmail.com/Inbox
    set record="imaps://imap.gmail.com/Sent"
    set postponed="imaps://imap.gmail.com/[Gmail]/Drafts"
    set mbox="imaps://imap.gmail.com/[Gmail]/All Mail"
    set trash = "imaps://imap.gmail.com/[Gmail]/Trash"
    set header_cache = "~/.mutt/cache/headers"
    set message_cachedir = "~/.mutt/cache/bodies"
    set certificate_file = "~/.mutt/certificates"
    # ================  SMTP  ====================
    set smtp_url = "smtp://username@smtp.gmail.com:587/"
    set smtp_pass = $imap_pass
    set ssl_force_tls = yes # Require encrypted connection
    # ================  Composition  ====================
    set editor = "gedit"      # Set your favourite editor.
    set edit_headers = yes  # See the headers when editing
    set send_charset="us-ascii:utf-8"     # value of $LANG; also fallback for send_charset
    # Sender, email address, and sign-off line must match
    unset use_domain        # because joe@localhost is just embarrassing
    set from = "username@gmail.com"
    set realname = "<should match with your account name with which you are going to signoff and commit>"
    set use_from = yes
    ```
    {% endcode %}
5. To checkout received mails in your Mutt Mailbox, you need to first **enable IMAP settings** from your Gmail account using the below method.
   1. Login to your [**Gmail account**](https://mail.google.com/) from your browser.
   2. From the top right, click **settings** ⚙️ > Then **“See all settings”**.
   3. Click the **Forwarding and POP/IMAP** tab.
   4. In the “IMAP access” section, select **Enable IMAP**.
   5. Finally click on **save changes**

#### Using mutt email client

1. open mutt gui with executing _`mutt`_ command in terminal
2. send an email by executing following command in terminal\
   `mutt -s "Test!"`\
   ``Press '**Enter'** and it will show up **'To: \<email-id>'**, press '**Enter'** once again. Next, it will display the specified subject **'Subject: Test!'**, again press '**Enter'**. Now it will open your default editor set in your terminal (Use **'echo $EDITOR'** to know) to write Email Body. \
   Once you are done with writing save it. Once you did, it will open up with an interface to confirm everything once again. If you want to make any changes like adding **CC** or **BCC** you can do it now. \
   If you are using VIM editor Press **ESC** and then **SHIFT+ZZ**. \
   For NANO users press **CTRL+X** and then **Y** for Yes. \
   For gedit goto terminal window. Once you are done press **Y** for Yes to send a message to the recipient.
3. You can use the echo command with the Mutt to pass the body of the email with a single command.\
   _`echo "Your Body Message" | mutt -s "Your Subject"  recipientusername@gmail.com`_\
   _``_Press **Enter** and wait for a few second while Mutt authenticating and send the email.
4. Send an email with attachment\
   _`echo "Your Body Message" | mutt -s "Your Subject"  recipientusername@gmail.com -a path-to-file1/file1.txt -a path-to-file2/file2.txt path-to-file3/file3.txt`_
5. Add Recipients in CC and BCC Mode\
   `mutt -s “Your Subject” -c username1_cc@gmail.com -b username2_bcc@gmail.com`\
   ``You can specify multiple CC and BCC, separate them using commas.
6. mutt to use that patch as a draft email, with the -H flag:\
   `mutt -H < your patch filename >`
7. refer [https://www.linux.com/training-tutorials/setup-mutt-gmail-centos-and-ubuntu/](https://www.linux.com/training-tutorials/setup-mutt-gmail-centos-and-ubuntu/), [https://trendoceans.com/how-to-install-and-configure-mutt-command-line-email-client/](https://trendoceans.com/how-to-install-and-configure-mutt-command-line-email-client/), [https://linuxconfig.org/how-to-install-configure-and-use-mutt-with-a-gmail-account-on-linux](https://linuxconfig.org/how-to-install-configure-and-use-mutt-with-a-gmail-account-on-linux)

### Git Post-Commit Hooks

* Git includes some _hooks_ for scripts that can be run before or after specific git commands are executed. Checking the patch for compliance and errors can be automated using git pre-commit and post-commit hooks. The _post-commit hook_ is run after you make a git commit with the **git commit** command.
  1. If you don't already have **/usr/share/codespell/dictionary.txt**, do:\
     _`sudo apt-get install codespell`_
  2.  If you already have a **.git/hooks/post-commit** file, move it to **.git/hooks/post-commit.sample**. git will not execute files with the **.sample** extension. Then, edit the **.git/hooks/post-commit** file to contain only the following two lines:

      <pre data-overflow="wrap" data-line-numbers><code><strong>#!bash 
      </strong><strong>#!/bin/sh 
      </strong>exec git show --format=email HEAD | ./scripts/checkpatch.pl --strict --codespell 
      # Make sure the file is executable: 
      chmod a+x .git/hooks/post-commit
      </code></pre>
  3. After you make the commit, this hook will output any **checkpatch** errors or warnings that your patch creates. If you see warnings or errors that you know you added, you can amend the commit by changing the file, using **git add** to add the changes, and then using **git commit --amend** to commit the changes.

## General guidelines for email client and sending patches for review

1. **Only Inline text/No attachments** - Patches for the Linux kernel are submitted via email, preferably as inline text in the body of the email. Some maintainers accept attachments, but then the attachments should have content-type `text/plain`. However, attachments are generally frowned upon/disapproved because it makes quoting portions of the patch more difficult in the patch review process.
2. **Plain Text/No HTML** - It’s also strongly recommended that you use plain text in your email body, for patches and other emails alike( No HTML mails. No attachments. ). [https://useplaintext.email](https://useplaintext.email/) may be useful for information on how to configure your preferred email client, as well as listing recommended email clients.
3. Email clients that are used for Linux kernel patches should send the patch text untouched. For example, they should not modify or delete tabs or spaces, even at the beginning or end of lines.( that’s why we don't use Gmail/outlook for Linux kernel development)
4. Don’t send patches with `format=flowed`. This can cause unexpected and unwanted line breaks.
5. Don’t let your email client do automatic word wrapping for you. This can also corrupt your patch.
6. Email clients should not modify the character set encoding of the text. Emailed patches should be in ASCII or UTF-8 encoding only. If you configure your email client to send emails with UTF-8 encoding, you avoid some possible charset problems.
7. Email clients should generate and maintain “References:” or “In-Reply-To:” headers so that mail threading is not broken.
8. Copy-and-paste (or cut-and-paste) usually does not work for patches because tabs are converted to spaces.
9. Don’t use PGP/GPG signatures in mail that contains patches. This breaks many scripts that read and apply the patches. (This should be fixable.)
10. **Plain text** - Please make sure that your email client is configured to use plain text emails. By default, many email clients compose emails with HTML
11. **bottom posting** - Some email clients will paste the entire email you're replying to into your response and encourage you to write your message over it. This behavior is called "top posting" and is discouraged . Instead, cut out any parts of the reply that you're not directly responding to and write your comments inline. Feel free to edit the original message as much as you like. For example: I email you,

    {% code overflow="wrap" lineNumbers="true" %}
    ```
    Hey ABC,
    Can you look into the bug which is causing 2.34 clients to disconnect
    immediately? I think this is related to the timeouts change last week.

    Also, your fix to the queueing bug is confirmed for the next release,
    thanks!
    ```
    {% endcode %}

    You might respond with:

    ```
    Hey XYZ, I can look into that for sure.
    > I think this is related to the timeouts change last week.

    I'm not so sure. I think reducing the timeouts would *improve* this issue,
    if anything.

    > Also, your fix to the queueing bug is confirmed for the next release,
    > thanks!

    Sweet! Happy to help.
    ```
12.
